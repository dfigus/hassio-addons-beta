  control_bypass:
    name: Control Bypass
    description: >-
      Let solarflow-control take over enabling/disabling the bypass of the hub (direct solarinput to hub output when
      battery is full) this overrides the automatic switching by the hub's firmware, which is sometimes a bit wierd.
  control_soc:

      Allow solarflow-control to change the SolarFlow Hub's minimum and maxiumum battery levels which are considered
      empty (stop discharging) or full (stop charging)

    description: >-
      The ID of the inverter connected to the AhoyDTU.
  sm_rapid_change_diff:
    name: Smartmeter Rapid Change Difference
    description: >-
      The rapid change difference defines the difference in W that has to be detected on the smartmeter readings to
      consider it a fast drop or rise in demand. This helps a faster adjustment in switching various limits e.g.
      when a water boiler is turned on/off
  sm_zero_offset:
    name: Smartmeter Zero Offset
    description: >-
      The zero offset defines the minimum power that is considered as a load. This is used to prevent the inverter
      from switching on/off when the smartmeter is reading a small amount of power (e.g. standby power)

    name: Generic Smartmeter Base Topic
    description: >-
      The MQTT base topic your generic smartmeter, Hichi, Tasmota, etc. reports to.
  sm_generic_cur_accessor:
    name: Generic Smartmeter Current Accessor
    description: >-
      The JSON accessor to the current power reading of your generic smartmeter. If Smartmeter reader posts
      { "Power": {"Power_curr": 120, "Total_in": 12345.6} } then the accessor would be Power.Power_curr
  sm_generic_total_accessor:
    name: Generic Smartmeter Total Accessor
    description: >-
      The JSON accessor to the total power reading of your generic smartmeter. If Smartmeter reader posts
      { "Power": {"Power_curr": 120, "Total_in": 12345.6} } then the accessor would be Power.Total_in
